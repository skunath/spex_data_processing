 | chapter 1<lf>in my younger years<comma> i found the world to be a strange and confusing place. thanks to the infinite wisdom that i now possess<comma> i see the world
 | n a whole new light. you are the lucky recipient of thhs knowledge. in the beginning<comma> there was paul. paul was born in the city of dayton ohio. this was
 | no accident. paul deliberately planned his birth to be in that town for numerous reasons<comma> most of which will be divulged later in this novel. while it m
 | y not have seemed an insignificant time at the moment<comma> may 11 1987 is now known as one of the most exciting days known to man. you know this day as 'pau
 | 's birthday'
 | chapter 2<lf>fast forward into the future. it is now may 12 1987. paul has been alive for nearly 24 hours. i opted to spend most of this time either crying
 | sleeping<comma> or a mixture of both. at this young age<comma> i was surely already creating big shoes for my sister<comma> who was 3 at the time<comma> to fill. as was expect
 | d<comma> i was the highlight of the maternity ward. mothers who had recently given birth would leave their children with nurses just so they could come see me
 | this was obviously a problem because the nurses also wanted to see the young<comma> yet handsome<comma> baby paul. the hospital was so proud to have been a part of
 | the birth of paul<comma> that not only did they waive the entire hospital bill<comma> but i was paid for being such an inspiration and large amount of excitement fo
 | the entire hospital<comma> if not world.
 | chapter 3<lf>the ride home was nothing short of amazing. exciting turn after exciting turn<comma> the vehicle carrying paul neared ever closer to his future resi
 | ence. the chariot for this momentous ride was none other than a glorious 1986 chevy cavalier hatchback. i could have had any number of vehicles take me
 | ack home<comma> porsches<comma> lambroghinis<comma> bentleys<comma> etc.<comma> but this car had special significance. this car was so special and luxurious<comma> that the driver could re
 | ove the key from the ignition of the car while it was running and use the key elsewhere. i believe i have now conveyed the extreme quality of this vehic
 | e. to provide some foreshadowing<comma> i regret to inform you that paul would never be fortunate enough to drive this vehicle<comma> being that its life cycle woul
 | be over before paul ever reached his 15.5 birthday when he got his temps. this drive through the streets of dayton<comma> and the reaching of the destination
 | of a blue house with a red roof and a red brick driveway<comma> was actually not as memorable for me as one may have expected. i blame this not on being an in
 | ant with the memory span of a goldfish<comma> but rather the fact that i was stuck in a car seat<comma> and couldn't see out the window. this was my first experienc
 | in a long line of experiences that i would have in my life in vehicles
 | chapter 4<lf>the trip into the house involved much stair walking<comma> not by me of course. i was simply freeloading<comma> riding comfortably in either a baby carrie
 | or just being carried. i can't remember which. i blocked that memory most likely simply because it didn't interest me. i now got to enter my room for t
 | e first time ever. not only was it smaller than my sister's room<comma> but it was also colder than her room as well. this was not a good start for her to mak
 | <comma> considering she would still have to live with me for at least another 15 years. it still seems more logical to me for a baby to have a larger room tha
 | her<comma> but i suppose that's just symantics. it was now beginning to feel like a bad episode of the real world to me. i was being expected to live with th
 | se people i didn't know in a house i wasn't used to for an indefinite amount of time. the downside i wouldn't even get a large cash prize if i survived
 | my stay there! instead i would be given a multitude of chores to complete and other miscelaneous menial tasks. it felt like some cruel joke<comma> and yet i w

 | . i finally couldn't take it any more. my conscience was slowly destroying my sanity. i decided to do the noble thing and turn myself in. it would be by
 | far the most challenging thing i would ever have to do as a 6 year old. i said my goodbye to my parents and sister and made the long trip to the police
 | tation (it's long when you have to make the entire trip on your tricycle). i explained my entire story to the police<comma> keeping in mind that they already
 | new me since i was their hero and idol. after 15 minutes of them laughing uncontrollably<comma> i was told that it was impossible and it happened 20 years bef
 | re i was even born. i decided to humor the police and pretend to be relieved.
 | haha we've got a wordsmith on our hands here!
 | chapter 8<lf>at age 7<comma> my life left something to be desired. while i narrowly avoided going to prison for the assassination of jfk<comma> i had unfortunately bee
 | caught and prosecuted for the chop shop i had been running out of my parents' garage for the past four years. business was good<comma> and i felt i should ha
 | e been praised for being such an entrepreneur<comma> unfortunately the 30 federal marshals that busted me did not feel the same way. i'd like to say i regret
 | t<comma> but given the opportunity i'd do it all over again. i was sentenced to 50 years in sing sing<comma> and got out after 1.5 years for good behavior<comma> and beca
 | se i had made some pretty powerful friends while in the joint. i had also become the leader of the most powerful gang there<comma> the grape slushies<comma> but a p

 | chapter 9<lf>at age 8 i had begun to fit back in with my 'peers'. i joined them in the proper school grade<comma> so i was now back in the third grade. i had gai
 | ed some new friends. i had one particularly good friend<comma> who will go by the name of 'lynyrd'. lynyrd was not nearly as smart as me<comma> and obviously not as
 | good looking<comma> but i forgave him for that. he loved music<comma> and was dead set on starting a band. unfortunately for him he wasn't nearly as popular as me<comma>
 | o he knew too few people to find the necessary members. luckily<comma> being the social butterfly that i was<comma> i fully appreciated the importance of networking
 | i had some talented friends<comma> so i mentioned something to my other friend<comma> who we will call 'skynyrd'.  i was wise beyond my years for matching those tw
 | up<comma> because they immediately hit it off. the band that these two formed is still popular today. as you may have guessed<comma> the name of this band is 'the
 | eatles'. after much of their begging<comma> i agreed to become their band manager. using my skills<comma> i managed to find two more talented friends to join their
 | and to bring the total up to 4. quite often people have<comma> and still do<comma> ask me 'd8<comma> how does it feel to have been such a major part of the formation of s
 | ch a wonderful band? you must be very pleased!' my response however is the same as always. i didn't do this for myself. i selflessly did this for the go

 | er my case. i finally saw what a problem i had after i was caught breaking into a candy store/ice cream shop. thanks to my overconsumption of sugar and
 | ce cream<comma> i was on a sugar high<comma> and suffered a painful and record breaking 17 consecutive ice cream headaches. i was rushed to the hospital where i was
 | administered a constant hot fudge iv drip to cure my headaches. i was ready to begin my new life. i started a sugar support group called children restra

 | maybe i already did
 | matt
 | never mind
 | are you a scary woman driver or a good one
 | i suppose that's a legit answer. i wouldn't call myself crazy<comma> but i definitely do a lot more reckless stuff alone than when i'm responsible for other p
 | oples safety. i just find it curious to hear about what most women think of their driving and driving skill
 | bahahaha are you serious?
 | haha<comma> no i just feel like that is ridiculous overkill and insanely dangerous. plus i could still beat it with my motorcycle anyway
 | hippopptomous feet. use that. it just sounds funny
 | too much mumbling
 | new zelanders mumble too much. i can't understand you. what're you doing up in your apt? base jumping?

 | psh<comma> typical new englander response

 | the video may very well be the best part of it
 | oh believe me they already have
 | i told you i was freaky
 | if you want me to<comma> i could hang around with you<comma> if i only knew if that's what you're into
 | pretending to be dead so you can get a free ride in a humvee or pickup or ambulance ?
 | if they ignore you it would just mean you aren't yelling enough. you could be the only iraqi with a boston accent
 | when you're from the midwest<comma> everyone from new england has a boston accent
 | you're terrible at sending texts
 | work on that
 | and buy your kids some presents
 | and buy me some presents
 | whose fault is that
 | that's kellys job. i wash my hands of her activities
 | i don't know your kids so i don't owe them anything

 | i can't decide if you should be flattered or offended
 | potato potato
 | the world is not enough
 | tomorrow never dies
 | you only live twice
 | a view to a kill
 | the living daylights
 | can't say i remember that last one. what was the plot again?
 | hmmm sorry<comma> but since its not a james bond movie<comma> i don't recognize it as a real movie
 | we're in the lead cause i'm awesome
 | i expect that kind of move from someone from boston and who loves boston
 | absolutely. even if it means buying coffee every 30 miles
 | tsk tsk. i should have expected you to cheat. the only way you know how to 'win' . . .
 | haha how dumb do you think i am? you obviously run that car
 | that's their loss. just means more money for you and me
 | plus they'll have to deal with friday vegas weekend rush traffic and we won't
 | except for the music. even you can't control that
 | make dinner reservations at chilis on a wed night?
 | speaking of which<comma> is that dinner tonight?
 | aaaaaaand we're already behind
 | crap! you already discovered my deep dark secret and you haven't even known me for 3 weeks! pleeeeeeaaaase don't tell anyone!
 | it's kinda dusty
 | sounds good considering i still have to pack stuff up. i don't like long drawn out dinners
 | fantastic. i don't think i interact red phone at all with you
 | i completely agree. it's a weird personality trait
 | as many as i want right? i mean all i have to do is go to confession and they all magically disappear. unfortunately for me i haven't gone in about 10 y
 | ars. but you<comma>re a good catholic so you go bi-weekl
 | haha you testing your limits of self control?
 | i thought matt's opinion was the law?
 | makes me wonder what the expectations were
 | no. what number phone is she?
 | who? in your car? i don't know what kyles has
 | bahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahhahaha!
 | you could always just slip a note into the oreos
 | no idea
 | that was a response. you quiet? lol
 | who is hotter<comma> anne hathaway or katie holmes?
 | good answer<comma> not to say holmes isn't though
 | easy. scarlet. angelina's lips are too big
 | jolie? i'm not well versed enough in her to comment on that
 | haha how so?
 | i heard that
 | i heard that
 | pwall
 | about my driving and living in midwest<comma> yes lol
 | besides<comma> i only give you a hard time cause i know you can handle it haha
 | katy perry or lady gaga? my response to this question would be in paragraph form so yours can be as well
 | actually you make fun of me so much that i have to cry myself to sleep at night
 | very good. i don't know her husband so i can't comment on him. i think its 2 different categories. gaga has good music and wins in sex appeal<comma> but would
 | 't constitute as hot compared to perry. but katy isn't smoking though<comma> just helps she is more normal than gaga. but to qualify for that <comma> all you have t
 | do is not wear a meat coa
 | were you by explosion?
 | i'll agree to that. you're the most animated person here<comma> so yes<comma> i'll admit<comma> you do make it a lot more fun
 | i'll understand if you don't know who these are since i'm a bit younger<comma> but amanda bynes<comma> or hillary duff?
 | sorta the same for me. although i used to deliver ice<comma> so i got used to being outside and driving all day. and i used to work at a refinery so i was out
 | ide a lot too. its weird getting used to computer all da
 | see anything exciting by your walkway?
 | lol. you don't think duff is at least incredibly cute? i completely agree amanda is hotter though. and if they were equal brunette still trumps blonde anyway
 | shakira or j-lo? i realize this is an easy answer though
 | haha well i saw one of their movies<comma> but i can't remember who was who. i'm sure the vampire is better looking<comma> but i think he's trouble<comma> so the wolf is
 | better choic
 | psh<comma> boring. throw a rock at it to stop it
 | hey i still chose amanda<comma> just think duff has some good qualities
 | oh i vote shakira for hottness and music. for sure
 | what was the correct twilight answer?
 | you yell at the stuff you saw in spanish?
 | i spy with my eye something that begins with the letter g
 | hillary swank or jennifer alba?
 | a
 | ten points to andy!
 | bahaha i bet you own every twilight book and movie ever made. but you still think the vampire is hot
 | my mistake george
 | oh shakira hands down. hot and good music. jlo annoys me kinda
 | alba is definitely hot<comma> but i feel like she's kinda tiny<comma> but i could be wrong. not to say i want  an amazonian woman or something
 | a
 | i'll judge you by your answer on this one. daniel craig<comma> or pierce brosdnand?
 | i wouldn't say i have a problem with it<comma> we're just stating opinions lol
 | we're like a barrel of monkies
 | on the same note<comma> sean connery or timothy dalton?
 | is that on purely looks? cause that means nothing to me. pierce is a better bond all the way
 | a
 | good answer. dalton is good in his movies<comma> but he's no sean connery
 | brad hands down. more of a badass + not insane + not a scientologist lol
 | a
 | i'm not sure if that has an answer. i don't see movies just because an actress is in it. i have a lot i like<comma> not any really i dislike. you?
 | well who does like lohan? let's face it<comma> nobody likes walking stds and drug deposittries
 | jennifer garner or megan fox?
 | see<comma> you scared it off. next time i recommend hijacking it
 | carmen electra or brittany daniel? and btw i changed my mind about not having a favorite actress. her name is in this text
 | good answer<comma> although it goes again with fox wins sex appeal and garner is hotter/beauty
 | a
 | food
 | she is in it's always sunny in philadelphia<comma> she is carmen. she was also in joe dirt as brandy. i think she is one of the hottest<comma> if not the hottest in
 | my personal opinio
 | asdf
 | she's brunette in its always sunny. but even if she wasn't<comma> she's still gorgeous
 | no such thing. we should have a sandcastle building competition
 | rrr
 | slow as molasses
 | jarhead or three kings?
 | very good movie. jarhead was alright but i didn't get excited over it
 | matt damon. although catch me if you can was an excellent movie
 | never saw the departed. i chose matt because of the bourne movies. can't argue that!
 | that's not a question. how can i respond to that?
 | kesha or kelly clarkson?
 | for dinner or lunch?
 | that's fine with me
 | yeah<comma> it is great
 | give a response for each. but i think your question to me answered it all lol
 | although kesha actually has some good songs
 | cher or madonna?
 | james taylor or paul simon?
 | fleetwood mac or simon and garfunkel?
 | i find kesha hot lol. but that's  just me
 | qqqqq
 | hmmm that last text is hard to read
 | hmmm i think jt may have paul on that one
 | something about you being great
 | fleetwood mac wins every time cause they deserve to win
 | ok
 | hmmm don't follow
 | r
 | t
 | i don't know about hotness but a fake british accent isn't appealing
 | what was your incredulous response to?
 | would you rather fall off a building knowing you would die<comma> or have to push your best friend off a building<comma> but they would only be paralyzed for life?
 | you hadn't responded to my last 3 texts so i had to send something!
 | you never answered me what your incredulous 'what' was for. plus its your turn for comparison questions!
 | you prob liked j.r.
 | damn phone keeps not getting texts. luke who. luke wilson?
 | here's an  easy one. fergie or gwen stefanie?
 | charlene tilton?
 | what? fergie is sooooooo much hotter. she is smoking hot
 | i'm not really sure who han solo is. i don't really know star wars
 | well she hides her height well then
 | does your life revolve around star wars or something?
 | a
 | luke wilson or owen wilson
 | rosie odonnel or oprah
 | haha i saw. i don't mind that one. he had no business cutting since we were all waiting on him
 | haha i loved that movie. i got excited when i got to see carl's jr out here lol<lf>-brought to you by carl's jr
 | rachel ray or ellen? btw rachel ray is hot
 | but water? like from a toilet?
 | any woman who can cook for me like that is amazing in my eyes
 | vanilla ice or right said fred?
 | i thought you people could only make pasta?
 | well good for you! what's your last name? what's rachel maiden name?
 | ex girlfriend or ex wife?
 | psh<comma> like you know what my last name is much less how to spell it
 | ex girlfriend<comma> no. but i base that purely on my ex girlfriends i've already had. it's not a rule in stone. varies case to case
 | i don't know what the mutually exclusive means
 | guess which car is going to be last in . . .
 | haha<comma> that sure wouldn't mess anything up at all
 | she calls it 'garfunkeling'
 | jermaine dresses up like art garfunkel cause that lady is obsessed with him. she calls it 'garfunkling'
 | oh i dunno. i talk a lot without direction
 | portia de rossi or ann hesche?
 | paul. name is better<comma> plus he didn't help destroy the group . . .
 | rocky i or rocky iv
 | but paul had wings. good songs
 | uh ivan drago! don't hate on dolph longrin
 | what was the 'really paul?' in reference to?
 | wait<comma> you think that argument actually helps your justification? lol
 | dave matthews band or red hot chili peppers
 | you would lol
 | yikes<comma> that's actually a hard one. i reserve the right for flip flop my answer at any time<comma> but i'm gonna choose soccer cause i miss it so much
 | i can start complaining about stuff instead if you prefer
 | i prefer outdoor. indoor is too artificial for me<comma> but it does give you a hell of a lot of running. you play growing up?
 | lol that is true<comma> i would never tire of that. i do worry i will run out of women to weigh in on with my opinions though
 | haha how long do you think that is?
 | haha that's surprising for a girl to like indoor more for the increased physicalness. girls are already mean and dirty as hell in soccer!
 | making some new friends?
 | prob some deep conversation with the donkey i bet
 | huh? what do i need a script for
 | you are creepily close. prob closer to 23.48 though
 | which towers do you and your car take down?
 | haha because they don't want to look like complete jerks for taking out a girl
 | which dave?
 | haha lucky you. you should take charge
 | because its not looked down upon for a girl to do that to a guy! double standard!
 | you google me or facebook stalk me or something?
 | throw every cinderblock off the roof
 | i'd say just throw. manslaughter isn't a good route to take<comma> even in iraq
 | haha wow<comma> i didn't realize you absorbed that much of my memoirs! i'm flattered
 | because you had a legitimate explanation for your knowledge<comma> i removed the title stalker from you. would you like me to add it back on?
 | your texts have very little content to them. you must have more to say
 | you sure? you do like yoyos after all
 | at least you picked out the one piece of factual information.
 | that's why you like elevators so much
 | how does he know when my birthday is?
 | i guess a 'thats what she said' fits in there<comma> but i'm not confident about it
 | is that so? i'm thinking of my favorite color right now. what is it?
 | that's what she said (thanks for the blatant setup)
 | you need to work on your psychic skills. orange is the correct answer
 | weak response
 | haha. well i am dutch after all. i'll also call it oranje
 | does that make you happy? or is that music on your crap list?
 | lol what do you mean by smushy?
 | so why did you start playing soccer? whole family did?
 | i have no control over the quality of the packages our vehicle is stocked with
 | how old were you then?
 | i don't follow . . .
 | ah of course bret's song!
 | a bit calmer. my kind of day
 | carol brown took the last bus out of town
 | unfortunately its been a bit since i played<comma> but i had started as stopper<comma> but became a permanent outside midfielder
 | ugh<comma> 80s music. not a fan of 80s pop. you have radio privileges?
 | is that part of the song? cause i don't remember those words in it
 | yeah a lot of people want to be just like me. i can't say i'm surprised. actually i spent high school living in my cousins shadows. same last name but t
 | ey played forward and actually scored goals unlike mysel
 | you think you know fashion? well fashion is a stranger to you
 | you've got a car murray. it's an '03 accord (only one previous owner)
 | rhymnoscerous and hiphopotopmous?
 | oh<comma> i'm supposed to be impressed? i could be nice and say yes<comma> but does that sound like me?
 | there ain't no party like my nana's tea party
 | i wish i had lol. your day slow as well?
 | see you have an unfair advantage. you're listening to the songs so of course you can quote them. all mine has to be strictly off memory
 | haha i think that might be a stretch saying he'll do anything. he could be wrapped around your finger though i suppose
 | inner city life<comma> inner city pressure<comma> the concrete world is starting to get ya
 | i haven't felt this bad since cheeky died. man i miss that monkey
 | you've sold everything<comma> everything you own. your toothbrush<comma> car<comma> and your cameraphone
 | 88.something is the base radio i think
 | rhymnoscerous episode. look it up or i'll peel your beard off
 | well i guess that's just your loss then huh?
 | you must not be a real fan of theirs<comma> considering how little of their quotes you know
 | with what?
 | bon jovi or bono?
 | sounds like it
 | or does it . . .
 | you rebels! haha
 | i like saying jon bon jovi. it has a fun ring to it
 | maybe this is after your time<comma> but step by step<comma> or full house?
 | says who? matt?
 | one two three four i declare thumb war
 | maybe this is after your time<comma> but step by step<comma> or full house?
 | i think some of the texts i've been sending haven't been going through
 | uh<comma> batman! who would ever want to be aquaman
 | that's jacobs team bonding
 | haha well i was born in the 80s so i'm not really sure
 | 31?
 | a
 | i'm better at eating fish. mahimahi or salmon. maybe something more exotic
 | so i assume i was completely correct with my guess so i have no reason to ask for your age now?
 | i don't really listen to them though
 | never been a big fan of sushi. tried it<comma> didn't hate it<comma> but won't go out looking for it
 | haha you're asking me which woman i'd rather be? i guess wonder<comma> but either would be weird i think
 | a
 | well i'm thinking wonder is more well endowed<comma> but then again maybe they named the wonder bra after her. but batgirl is much more form fitting<comma> plus she
 | doesn't wear a cape. capes are just weird. i guess bat gir
 | doesn't wear a cape. capes are just weird. i guess bat gir
 | a
 | i'm too uncultured. its a major personality flaw
 | haha amazon thing? perhaps before my time. elaborate
 | i was not aware of her background. she is quite fair skinned for being an amazonian though
 | haha guess my generation missed out on a lot. i blame my parents
 | oh that is just one of many
 | oh you should know<comma> the problem you described outside the car is known as paul wall withdrawl. many many many females suffer from it
 | a
 | even wonderwoman was still a woman despite her skills
 | if you could only do one thing in vegas<comma> what would it be?
 | bet the min

 | 1987 are you sure they based the wonder years off of you the show was cancelled in about '93.
 | do you remember when the wonder years was cancelled?
 | i can live with that.
 | chapter 5<lf>the early years started off slow. my life consisted of a ridiculous amount of soccer<comma> running bicycle riding<comma> and oddly enough<comma> school. the sc
 | ool was a slap in the face<comma> an insult<comma> claiming that i didn't naturally know enough information to survive on my own in the real world. i decided to hum
 | r my parents and go through through motions of growing up. i went along with them thinking they were the ones who potty trained me<comma> taught me how to rid
 | a bicycle<comma> to not eat glue<comma> and not pick my nose. a lot of details can't be fully described in these memoirs because i already sold a lot of the rights
 | to my childhood and my memories to the show 'the wonder years'. as you might now realize<comma> +75% of the show is based on my life. fred savage has referred
 | to me as his 'lifetime hero and role model' on numerous occasions.  many of the memories i chose to retain the rights to<comma> however<comma> are still 10x better
 | han that show ever was. for example<comma> i vividly  remember that by age 5 i had already built the world's fastest soapbox derby car<comma> and a monopoly on the

 | trying to keep my mouth shut;  can't do it.  i only lasted 5 min...
 | yes<comma> i'm doing better than expected.
 | i had low expectations.  the desert environment makes me a little crazy.  i'm usually really quiet and shy...
 | is that a response or are you just  really bored?
 | this is a new direction... anne hathaway<comma> definately
 | angelina or scarlet?

 | leo dicaprio or matt damon<comma> this very important
 | no way.  leo all the way on the departed.  favorite movie.  hated matt damon in it<comma> but that's why he is such a good actor
 | matt is feeling neglected...
 | well are we talking  music or pure hottness?
 | ok npw i'm felling neglected
 | kelly clarkson has much better music<comma> but i don<comma>t like keisha at all so that detracts from her hottnesa
 | paul simon - definately
 | that's really tough.  they are both awesome.  but stevie is hotter
 | so apparently you think everyone is hot
 | madonna has better music<comma> but i think cher is hotter<comma> or she used to be till her lips got huge

 | chapter 1<lf>in my younger years<comma> i found the world to be a strange and confusing place. thanks to the infinite wisdom that i now possess<comma> i see the world
 | n a whole new light. you are the lucky recipient of thhs knowledge. in the beginning<comma> there was paul. paul was born in the city of dayton ohio. this was
 | no accident. paul deliberately planned his birth to be in that town for numerous reasons<comma> most of which will be divulged later in this novel. while it m
 | y not have seemed an insignificant time at the moment<comma> may 11 1987 is now known as one of the most exciting days known to man. you know this day as 'pau
 | 's birthday'
 | sounds good
 | chapter 2<lf>fast forward into the future. it is now may 12 1987. paul has been alive for nearly 24 hours. i opted to spend most of this time either crying
 | sleeping<comma> or a mixture of both. at this young age<comma> i was surely already creating big shoes for my sister<comma> who was 3 at the time<comma> to fill. as was expect
 | sleeping<comma> or a mixture of both. at this young age<comma> i was surely already creating big shoes for my sister<comma> who was 3 at the time<comma> to fill. as was expect
 | sn't laughing
 | d<comma> i was the highlight of the maternity ward. mothers who had recently given birth would leave their children with nurses just so they could come see me
 | this was obviously a problem because the nurses also wanted to see the young<comma> yet handsome<comma> baby paul. the hospital was so proud to have been a part of
 | the birth of paul<comma> that not only did they waive the entire hospital bill<comma> but i was paid for being such an inspiration and large amount of excitement fo
 | which one
 | the entire hospital<comma> if not world.
 | chapter 3<lf>the ride home was nothing short of amazing. exciting turn after exciting turn<comma> the vehicle carrying paul neared ever closer to his future resi
 | ence. the chariot for this momentous ride was none other than a glorious 1986 chevy cavalier hatchback. i could have had any number of vehicles take me
 | ack home<comma> porsches<comma> lambroghinis<comma> bentleys<comma> etc.<comma> but this car had special significance. this car was so special and luxurious<comma> that the driver could re
 | ove the key from the ignition of the car while it was running and use the key elsewhere. i believe i have now conveyed the extreme quality of this vehic
 | e. to provide some foreshadowing<comma> i regret to inform you that paul would never be fortunate enough to drive this vehicle<comma> being that its life cycle woul
 | be over before paul ever reached his 15.5 birthday when he got his temps. this drive through the streets of dayton<comma> and the reaching of the destination
 | of a blue house with a red roof and a red brick driveway<comma> was actually not as memorable for me as one may have expected. i blame this not on being an in
 | ant with the memory span of a goldfish<comma> but rather the fact that i was stuck in a car seat<comma> and couldn't see out the window. this was my first experienc
